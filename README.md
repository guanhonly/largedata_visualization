In the era of big data, data exploration and visualization are very important. The increase of volume and dimension of data makes it difficult for people to obtain useful information quickly. In order to solve the problem of visualization of point-like big data in space-time multi-dimensional scene, this paper presents a data organization model that combines tile pyramid and key-value pairs. Multi-dimensional Aggregation Pyramid (MAP) , and we design and implement a set of open source visualization framework (MAP-Vis) based on MAP model. The MAP organizational model can take into account both spatial and multi-scale problems, time and other dimensions. The design of open source visualization framework (MAP-Vis), takes Spark as the parallel preprocessing tool, and take HBase as the database to storage MAP model data. Under big data conditions, the system can support sub-second query response, and data can be visualized interactively.
